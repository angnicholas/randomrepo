# The Non-Exhaustive Guide to Debugging, Initialisation, Setup and Configuration
## v2.0

The hardest part of all software engineering projects is setting up/configuration, especially when it is undocumented.

This document compiles all the setup+weird debugging I ever had to do in my life in case I ever need to refer to it again.

I am in the process of bringing some stuff in my google doc over.

Everything below this line is programmatically generated by a script.
