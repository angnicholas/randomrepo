Music Theory for 99% of pop songs

## Chords

1. Normal (in-the-key): `I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi -> I ...` or `1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 1`

Now, you can play chords with keys that are "out-of-scale" by invoking certain out-of-key notes:

2. [The funky `II`](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1PfRUiisKatPPyV0oll8R9?si=2c5bc77341ae4a94) (invokes `F# in Modulo C`)

    - xiao-xing-yun (hebe tian)

3. [The funky `III`](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Ahz8Ui3hA4Z2W0hpZAHno?si=4eb852118b4943b0) (invokes `G#` in `Modulo C`)

    - cai hong (jay chou)
    - ano yumewo nazotte (yoasobi)
    - ji fen zhi ji (crowd lu)
    - some (soyou)
    - etc... (there are many)

4. [The sad `iv`](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5KYE7tH3AJz30Ph3qPcwvO?si=e671cc0a3be1421f) (also invokes `G#` in `Modulo C`)

    - how far i'll go (disney)
    - que kou (harlem yu)
    - candy pop (twice)
    - a lot of twice songs lmao
    - a lot of sad songs

5. The funky `v` (invokes `Bb` in `Modulo C`)
This is basically the same as I dom 7 (ie. `C7 modulo C`) lmao

    - racing through the night (yoasobi)
    - [this thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S05K4VT-2b4)

6. [Funky `VI`](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6cNPSvJosJpEkQ606r1voP?si=29e3a0b4ea5245b1) (invokes `C#` in `Modulo C`). 
very bright and spicy.  
Also good for a ```VI -> ii -> V -> I```.  
    - start (depapepe) 
    - deng yi ge ren (lin hsin yi)
    - after like (ive)
    - etc...

7. [Disney `bVII`](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0KIHqcK1UE9M6iFf3DjIoi?si=c0dde7acb7f248b5) (invokes `Bb` in `Modulo C`).
    - For the first time in forever 
    - literally any disney song lmao

8. [Dim 7s](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7LCasYOJoTaSi8oBNbd47k?si=d24f33cbcbd04d36)
Because of modulo there are "only 3 dim 7s in the world"
I'm not too sure about these so the songs are just taken from the chord pages
    - deng yi ge ren
    - zig zag (weeekly)
    - onnanoko ni naritai

# Chord Progressions and Patterns

9. Four chords `permute(I V vi IV)` - covers a lot of songs

10. Sometimes you can substitute: `iii <-> V`, `ii <-> IV` and `vi <-> I`. This is because of "functions", I think

11. Canon in D (Bach 1600 or something Idk the year lmao) - you could almost force fit this to anything
`I V vi iii IV I IV V` - very harmony

12. Cadences - always works to end a phrase - i know there are names for these but I don't really care lol
    - `ii -> V -> I` 
    - `IV -> V -> I`
    - `V -> vi`
    then of course you can do the swaps 
    - `II -> V -> I` etc.
    and add sevens if you want
    - `V dom 7 - I maj 7` whatever it doesnt rlly matter

13. [`I III vi v, IV V iii vi, ii V`](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6IbMuBbrsDfzADKivXT4sW?si=486c16b79be44f13)  
If you get liberal with swapping things out you have quite a lot of freedom.
Eg. a variant on canon in D that began to pick up traction...

14. [`ii V I vi`](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6B8akzdVDfi1sCbeAbP7oK?si=ebd279b9f2754226)
Nothing special about this but I quite like these songs so

# Embellishments and Mental Shortcuts
15. `sus2 sus4 add2 add4` anything always works, similarly ending on a `IV or V or I sus2` arpeggio almost always works

16. Ending on the `iv` always works (when it is sad / contemplative song)

17. Hitting the `I maj 7` always works

18. Going `V (dom) 7 -> I` almost always works, same for `I (dom) 7 -> IV`

19. `III -> vi` almost always works in place of `iii -> vi` 

20. `8 7 5` almost always works

# Key Change / Modulation

21. [Normie change (2 semitones up)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4I9W8YjblIyGWDxq0lUNHV?si=789714960a2a4656)
    - tong hua (guang liang)

22. [Relative minor/major change (3 semitones up)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4ex5LFrMZ5TvLvK3pKUvgd?si=27f10acbc2c74c07)
Imagine I am shifting from A to C. Notice that:
    - G is the five (V) of C and also the Disney seven (bVII) of A.
    - E is the funky three (III) of C  and also the five (V) of A.  
Therefore, it is very common.   
    - Knock knock (twice) (very short)
    - zig zag (weeekly)
    - shooting star (kotoko)
    - adrenaline (trysail) (E -> G)
    - eternal reality (fripside)
    - im lazy to type out the rest so just look at the spotify

23. [Mixolydian (flat 7)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/60URjEShN5v32Ln8pLjLrU?si=ea15112b49f24d5b)
kpop

    - as if it's your last (blackpink)
    - a lot of the blackpink songs lmao

24. [4 semitones~~1!!](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2MznZknna98NpVDYzNfugJ?si=ab4fe04ad0714920)  
Be limitless, anything works when you try hard enough
